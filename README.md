# Options-Wizard 

This package provides the functionality to backtest and evaluate trade strategys in Python. This was originally built for options data so prioritises efficient computation through the evaluation of strategies serially (using polars), but with backtesting performed in the cross section to generate accurate AUM figures and margin requirements. This is designed to integrate into existing databases and is compatible with SQL. Have a look at the examples, or read through the docs to find out more. 

## To do
- Intraday evaluation
- Case studies (using yf data?)
