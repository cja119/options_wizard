# To do 🔎

## In the Pipeline
- Intraday evaluation
- Case studies (using yf data?)
- Docs
- Build some out the box regression models for use too.
- Make universe a customizable base such that users can define their own instances for specific applications.
- Add greek calculations to options definitions so can be used for sizing (thinking notional exposure targeting)

## Feature Ideas?
- Come up with a better package name(?)
- Cross sectional model fitting (may be hard (?))
